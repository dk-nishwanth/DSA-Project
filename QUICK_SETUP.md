# 🚀 Quick Setup for Real Code Execution

Get **real compilation and execution** for all programming languages in 2 minutes!

## ✅ Supported Languages

Your platform now supports **real execution** for:

- **JavaScript** - Node.js runtime with full standard library
- **Python** - Python 3.x with standard library and imports
- **Java** - OpenJDK with complete Java standard library
- **C** - GCC compiler with full standard library
- **C++** - G++ compiler with STL support
- **C#** - Mono compiler with .NET framework
- **PHP** - PHP interpreter with standard functions
- **Ruby** - Ruby interpreter with gems
- **Go** - Official Go compiler with standard library
- **Rust** - Rustc compiler with Cargo support
- **SQL** - SQLite database engine
- **HTML/CSS** - Live web preview with validation

## 🎯 2-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Get Free API Key
1. Visit [RapidAPI Judge0](https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce/)
2. Click "Subscribe to Test"
3. Choose **FREE** plan (500 executions/month)
4. Copy your API key

### Step 2: Configure
**Option A: Environment Variable**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAPIDAPI_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Option B: In-App Setup**
1. Click "Setup Required" button in code playground
2. Enter API key
3. Click "Test Connection"

### Step 3: Test
```javascript
// Try this JavaScript code
console.log("✅ Real execution working!");
console.log("Current time:", new Date().toISOString());
```

## 🔧 How It Works

The system uses **multiple execution services** with intelligent fallbacks:

1. **Judge0 API** (Primary) - Professional service used in competitive programming
2. **Piston API** (Backup) - Free alternative, no API key needed
3. **Local JavaScript** (Special) - Real JS execution in browser
4. **Enhanced Simulation** (Fallback) - If all services unavailable

## ✨ What Students Get

- **Real compiler errors** with line numbers
- **Actual program output** from stdout/stderr
- **Performance metrics** (execution time, memory usage)
- **Interactive programs** that can read input
- **Professional development environment**

## 🎓 Example Programs

### Python
```python
print("✅ Python working!")
import datetime
print("Time:", datetime.datetime.now())
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print("Sum:", sum(numbers))
```

### Java
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("✅ Java working!");
        System.out.println("Time: " + java.time.LocalDateTime.now());
        int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println("Array length: " + numbers.length);
    }
}
```

### C++
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "✅ C++ working!" << endl;
    vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    cout << "Vector size: " << numbers.size() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## 🛡️ Security & Limits

- **Sandboxed execution** - Code runs in isolated containers
- **Time limits** - 10 second maximum execution time
- **Memory limits** - 256MB maximum memory usage
- **Free tier** - 500 executions/month (plenty for learning!)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Setup Required" showing?
- Get free RapidAPI key and configure it
- System works with simulation until configured

### Code not executing?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API key is correct
- System automatically falls back to other services

### Slow execution?
- First execution may be slower (cold start)
- Subsequent executions are faster

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Your DSA learning platform now has **real code execution**! Students can:

✅ Write actual programs that compile and run  
✅ See real compiler errors and learn debugging  
✅ Get immediate feedback on their code  
✅ Practice in multiple programming languages  
✅ Experience professional development tools  

The system handles all complexity automatically - students just write code and see real results!
