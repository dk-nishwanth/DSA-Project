## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

### **Major Discrepancy Discovered:**
The memory indicates all sorting algorithms are "100% complete with comprehensive content," but actual file examination reveals:

1. **Merge Sort**: Missing quiz questions only
2. **Other Sorting Algorithms**: Likely missing multiple components (need detailed verification)

### **Required Components Checklist:**
For each sorting algorithm, we need:
- ‚úÖ Extended Definition
- ‚úÖ Voice Explanation  
- ‚úÖ Real World Applications
- ‚úÖ Key Concepts
- ‚úÖ Pseudocode
- ‚úÖ Implementation Code
- ‚úÖ Quiz Questions (5 with explanations)

## üìã IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

1. **Verify each sorting algorithm individually**
2. **Add missing components systematically**
3. **Ensure all algorithms match the comprehensive standard set by Merge Sort**

The memory appears to be inaccurate - most sorting algorithms likely need significant enhancement to reach production-ready status.
