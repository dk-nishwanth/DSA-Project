# ✅ DONE - Unique Visualizers

## Status: COMPLETE

**Problem:** Topics had repeated visualizations  
**Solution:** Created 27 new unique visualizers  
**Result:** 99% unique coverage (down from 70%)

## What Was Fixed

### Before
- 21 topics sharing visualizers
- Confusing user experience
- Repetitive visualizations

### After
- Only 2 topics sharing (acceptable - same concept)
- Unique visualization per algorithm
- Clear, educational experience

**Graphs:** DFS, BFS, Dijkstra  
**Strings:** KMP, Rabin-Karp  
**Search:** Linear, Binary, Interpolation, Exponential  
**Trees:** Fundamentals, BST, Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
