# Gmail SMTP Configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com

# Instructions:
# 1. Replace 'your-email@gmail.com' with your Gmail address
# 2. Replace 'your-app-password' with your Gmail App Password
# 3. Replace 'super-admin@example.com' with the super admin's email
# 4. Enable 2FA on your Gmail account
# 5. Generate an App Password: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

# Email Features:
# - Welcome Email: Sent to new users upon registration
# - Login Notification: Sent when users log in
# - Admin Notifications: Sent to super admin when new admins register
# - Approval/Rejection Emails: Sent when admin accounts are approved/rejected

# Troubleshooting:
# - If you see "Missing credentials for 'PLAIN'" error, check that EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS are correctly set
# - For Gmail with 2FA, you MUST use an App Password, not your regular password
